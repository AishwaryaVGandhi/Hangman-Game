This project brings the classic Hangman game to life using Python. Hangman is a word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. Each incorrect guess results in a part of a stick figure being drawn, representing the gallows. The goal is to guess the word before the entire figure is completed.
